This is a fork of Liketechnik-s-Tinker-Tweaks, which is itself a fork of Tinker Tool Leveling. Liketechnik-s-Tinker-Tweaks adds random modifiers to your tool when it levels up, but unlike the old Iguana's Tinker Tweaks, there are no special chat messages letting you know which modifier you got. This fork simply re-adds those messages for all vanilla Tinker modifiers, plus configuration options to change the messages or add new ones for other modifiers.


# Liketechnik's Tinker Tweaks

This mod basically gives you back the behaviour of the old [Iguana Tinker Tweaks](https://github.com/SlimeKnights/IguanaTweaksTConstruct) for MC 1.7.10 (and downwards). It is based on [Tinker's Tool Leveling](https://github.com/SlimeKnights/TinkersToolLeveling), but has a completely different behaviour: For every new level, you get a random modifier applied to your tool. If you want to go fully crazy, you can configure the mod to give you a free modifier every level on top of that.

# Download

This mod is currently only available for MC 1.12. You can find the latest release on GitHub: https://github.com/liketechnik/Liketechnik-s-Tinker-Tweaks/releases

To use this mod you obviously need Tinker's Construct.

# Credits

This mod forked from  [Tinker's Tool Leveling](https://github.com/SlimeKnights/TinkersToolLeveling), that provided the base for this mod. I'm really thankfull for their mod (you can find the reason for the fork here: https://github.com/SlimeKnights/TinkersToolLeveling/issues/8), if you just want the free modifiers, go there.

The idea comes from  [Iguana Tinker Tweaks](https://github.com/SlimeKnights/IguanaTweaksTConstruct), that added the bahaviour in MC 1.7.10.
